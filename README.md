Cybersecurity "professional statement"

I am Kasey Chang. I have always enjoyed working with technology and solving complex problems. As a new cybersecurity analyst, I am committed to applying my existing IT and programming knowledge, as well as cybersecurity best practices and utilizing security tools to safeguard people from evolving cyber threats and breaches. 

Items in this repo are incident response, audits, and analysis as a part of my attempt to earn a Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I already have Google IT Support and other certificates.
